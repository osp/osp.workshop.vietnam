Open Design Weeks Vietnam
===========

Five OSPs travel to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, to participate in Open Design Week. Alex, John, Pierre, Pierre and Stéphanie will be touring through the Mekong Delta to meet up with local F/LOSS fans through workshops, presentations and an exhibition. The second week is reserved for an intense work session with the aim to produce a collaborative font between Asian and European participants. This font will be used to produce a publication on-the-spot. Open Design Week is initiated by Mario Behling and Hong Phuc Dang. Hong Phuc came to Brussels in 2010 for the 5th edition of the Libre Graphics Meeting, and hopefully she’ll be at LGM 2011 too. Bon Voyage OSP!
